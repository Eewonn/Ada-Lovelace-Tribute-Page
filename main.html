            <h2>Who Was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
            <p id="description">
              The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess
              of Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for
              mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an
              invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because
              she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the
              first computer programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.

            <h2>Contribution</h2>
            <p id="description">
              Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not
              discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the
              world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought:
              A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada
              has received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the
              U.S. Department of Defense named a newly developed computer
              language "Ada," after Lovelace.
