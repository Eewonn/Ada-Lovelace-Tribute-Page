            <h2>Who Was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
            <p id="description">
              English mathematician and author Augusta Ada King, Countess of
              Lovelace (n√©e Byron. lived from 10 December 1815 to 27 November
              1852), popularly known as Ada Lovelace, is primarily recognized
              for her contributions to Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a
              mechanical general-purpose computer. She was the first to realize
              that there were uses for the machine than simple computation.

            <p id="description">
              It wasn't until the 1950s that Lovelace's contributions to
              computer science were recognized. B.V. Bowden reintroduced her
              notes to the world. Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital
              Computing Machines, written by Bowden, was reissued in 1953. Ada
              has now won numerous posthumous awards for her efforts. 1980 saw
              the U.S. A recently created computer language was given the name
              "Ada," in honor of Lovelace, by the Department of Defense.
